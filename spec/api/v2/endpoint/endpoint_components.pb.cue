	// of the weights of all endpoints in the endpoint's locality to produce a
	// percentage of traffic for the endpoint. This percentage is then further
	// weighted by the endpoint's locality's load balancing weight from
	// LocalityLbEndpoints. If unspecified, each host is presumed to have equal
	// weight in a locality. The sum of the weights of all endpoints in the
	// endpoint's locality must not exceed uint32_t maximal value (4294967295).
