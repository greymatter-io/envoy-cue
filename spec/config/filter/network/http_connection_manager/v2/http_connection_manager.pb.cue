	idle_timeout?: string
	// The stream idle timeout for connections managed by the connection manager.
	// If not specified, this defaults to 5 minutes. The default value was selected
	// so as not to interfere with any smaller configured timeouts that may have
	// existed in configurations prior to the introduction of this feature, while
	// introducing robustness to TCP connections that terminate without a FIN.
	//
	// This idle timeout applies to new streams and is overridable by the
	// :ref:`route-level idle_timeout
	// <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout>`. Even on a stream in
	// which the override applies, prior to receipt of the initial request
	// headers, the :ref:`stream_idle_timeout
	// <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`
	// applies. Each time an encode/decode event for headers or data is processed
	// for the stream, the timer will be reset. If the timeout fires, the stream
	// is terminated with a 408 Request Timeout error code if no upstream response
	// header has been received, otherwise a stream reset occurs.
	//
	// This timeout also specifies the amount of time that Envoy will wait for the peer to open enough
	// window to write any remaining stream data once the entirety of stream data (local end stream is
	// true) has been buffered pending available window. In other words, this timeout defends against
	// a peer that does not release enough window to completely write the stream, even though all
	// data has been proxied within available flow control windows. If the timeout is hit in this
	// case, the :ref:`tx_flush_timeout <config_http_conn_man_stats_per_codec>` counter will be
	// incremented. Note that :ref:`max_stream_duration
	// <envoy_api_field_core.HttpProtocolOptions.max_stream_duration>` does not apply to this corner
	// case.
	//
	// Note that it is possible to idle timeout even if the wire traffic for a stream is non-idle, due
	// to the granularity of events presented to the connection manager. For example, while receiving
	// very large request headers, it may be the case that there is traffic regularly arriving on the
	// wire while the connection manage is only able to observe the end-of-headers event, hence the
	// stream may still idle timeout.
	//
	// A value of 0 will completely disable the connection manager stream idle
	// timeout, although per-route idle timeout overrides will continue to apply.
	stream_idle_timeout?: string
	// The amount of time that Envoy will wait for the entire request to be received.
	// The timer is activated when the request is initiated, and is disarmed when the last byte of the
	// request is sent upstream (i.e. all decoding filters have processed the request), OR when the
	// response is initiated. If not specified or set to 0, this timeout is disabled.
	request_timeout?: string
	// The time that Envoy will wait between sending an HTTP/2 “shutdown
	// notification” (GOAWAY frame with max stream ID) and a final GOAWAY frame.
	// This is used so that Envoy provides a grace period for new streams that
	// race with the final GOAWAY frame. During this grace period, Envoy will
	// continue to accept new streams. After the grace period, a final GOAWAY
	// frame is sent and Envoy will start refusing new streams. Draining occurs
	// both when a connection hits the idle timeout or during general server
	// draining. The default grace period is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) if this
	// option is not specified.
	drain_timeout?: string
	// The delayed close timeout is for downstream connections managed by the HTTP connection manager.
	// It is defined as a grace period after connection close processing has been locally initiated
	// during which Envoy will wait for the peer to close (i.e., a TCP FIN/RST is received by Envoy
	// from the downstream connection) prior to Envoy closing the socket associated with that
	// connection.
	// NOTE: This timeout is enforced even when the socket associated with the downstream connection
	// is pending a flush of the write buffer. However, any progress made writing data to the socket
	// will restart the timer associated with this timeout. This means that the total grace period for
	// a socket in this state will be
	// <total_time_waiting_for_write_buffer_flushes>+<delayed_close_timeout>.
	//
	// Delaying Envoy's connection close and giving the peer the opportunity to initiate the close
	// sequence mitigates a race condition that exists when downstream clients do not drain/process
	// data in a connection's receive buffer after a remote close has been detected via a socket
	// write(). This race leads to such clients failing to process the response code sent by Envoy,
	// which could result in erroneous downstream processing.
	//
	// If the timeout triggers, Envoy will close the connection's socket.
	//
	// The default timeout is 1000 ms if this option is not specified.
	//
	// .. NOTE::
	//    To be useful in avoiding the race condition described above, this timeout must be set
	//    to *at least* <max round trip time expected between clients and Envoy>+<100ms to account for
	//    a reasonable "worst" case processing time for a full iteration of Envoy's event loop>.
	//
	// .. WARNING::
	//    A value of 0 will completely disable delayed close processing. When disabled, the downstream
	//    connection's socket will be closed immediately after the write flush is completed or will
	//    never close if the write flush does not complete.
