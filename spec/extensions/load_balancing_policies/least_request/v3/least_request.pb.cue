	// The number of random healthy hosts from which the host with the fewest active requests will
	// be chosen. Defaults to 2 so that we perform two-choice selection if the field is not set.
	choice_count?: uint32
	// The following formula is used to calculate the dynamic weights when hosts have different load
	// balancing weights:
	//
	// `weight = load_balancing_weight / (active_requests + 1)^active_request_bias`
	//
	// The larger the active request bias is, the more aggressively active requests will lower the
	// effective weight when all host weights are not equal.
	//
	// `active_request_bias` must be greater than or equal to 0.0.
	//
	// When `active_request_bias == 0.0` the Least Request Load Balancer doesn't consider the number
	// of active requests at the time it picks a host and behaves like the Round Robin Load
	// Balancer.
	//
	// When `active_request_bias > 0.0` the Least Request Load Balancer scales the load balancing
	// weight by the number of active requests at the time it does a pick.
	//
	// The value is cached for performance reasons and refreshed whenever one of the Load Balancer's
	// host sets changes, e.g., whenever there is a host membership update or a host load balancing
	// weight change.
	//
	// .. note::
	//   This setting only takes effect if all host weights are not equal.
